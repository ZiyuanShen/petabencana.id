# petabencana-aurelia

Example template using the [Aurelia Framework](http://aurelia.io/)

To get up and running:
- Install Aurelia CLI: `npm install aurelia-cli -g`
- Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the development server: `npm start`

This will start a dev server on localhost:9000

The project structure is as follows:

- **assets**: static assets such as images
- **auerlia_project**: Aurelia generated folder containing config and framework specific libraries
- **locales**: transalation files for supported locales (en and id currently)
- **scripts**: generated scripts from the build process
- **src**: the main application code
- **test**: the tests to run (`npm test`)

To generate a production build run `npm run build` - this will generate new scripts in scripts/ and also auto increment the reference numbers in index.html.  Upload the following to the deployment destination (e.g. S3 bucket) protecting the structure:

```
assets/*
locales/*
scripts/*
index.html
favicon.ico
```

To test the build locally a static server can be used e.g. https://github.com/scottcorgan/pushstate-server
